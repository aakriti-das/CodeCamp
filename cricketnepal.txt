//Cricket, the sport that has re-conquered thousands of Nepalese all around the world, 
//was first of all introduced to Nepal by the ruling Rana Dynasty when they returned from 
//tudies in England and India in 1920s though the game was kept very much within them. 
//They started some developmental program; the establishment of Cricket Association of Nepal in 1946 to 
//promote the cricket amongst the aristocracy was one of them.
